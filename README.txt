VBMFA is a variational approximation to a full Bayesian implementation
of Mixtures of Factor Analysers.

DEMOS:	
	run
	1) demo_cake_ssl
	2) demo_gauss_ssl
	3) demo_spiral_ssl
	4) demo_ring_ssl
	5) demo_chainlink_ssl
	6) demo_atom_ssl
	
The code should work, but is by no means perfect and is both redundant and potentially 
buggy.
